<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Ultrasonic Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetostrictive</li><li>Piezoelectric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental ultrasonic device market is primarily divided into two types: magnetostrictive and piezoelectric. Magnetostrictive devices utilize a stack of metal strips that vibrate when an electric current passes through, producing a broad range of ultrasonic frequencies suitable for scaling and periodontal treatment. In contrast, piezoelectric devices use ceramic crystals that convert electrical energy into mechanical vibrations, offering precise control and less heat generation. Both types are essential for effective dental hygiene and treatment, catering to varying clinical requirements.</p></p>
