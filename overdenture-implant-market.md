<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overdenture Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tooth-Supported Overdentures</li><li>Implant-Supported Overdentures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The overdenture implant market consists of two primary types: tooth-supported overdentures and implant-supported overdentures. Tooth-supported overdentures rely on remaining natural teeth for stability, using them as anchors, which can enhance comfort and aesthetic appeal.
