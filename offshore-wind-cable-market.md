<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Offshore Wind Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inter-Array Cable</li><li>Export Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The offshore wind cable market comprises two primary types: inter-array cables and export cables. Inter-array cables connect individual wind turbines within a wind farm, facilitating the transmission of electricity generated by each turbine to the central offshore substation. Export cables, on the other hand, transport the aggregated electricity from the substation to the onshore grid, ensuring that renewable energy reaches consumers. Both cable types are essential for the efficient operation and integration of offshore wind energy systems.</p></p>
