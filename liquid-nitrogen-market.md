<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Nitrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cryogenic Distillation</li><li>Pressure Swing Adsorption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquid Nitrogen market is primarily driven by two key production methods: Cryogenic Distillation and Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA). Cryogenic Distillation involves cooling air to extremely low temperatures to separate nitrogen from other gases, yielding high-purity liquid nitrogen. It is energy-intensive but efficient for large-scale production. PSA, on the other hand, uses adsorbent materials to separate nitrogen from air under varying pressures, offering cost-effective, smaller-scale solutions. Both methods cater to diverse industries, including healthcare, food preservation, and electronics, based on purity and volume requirements.</p></p>
