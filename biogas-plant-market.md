<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biogas plant market is primarily categorized into two types: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion utilizes high moisture content feedstocks, such as food waste and agricultural residues, which are mixed with water to facilitate microbial breakdown in a liquid environment. In contrast, dry digestion processes low moisture organic materials, like energy crops and manure, in a more solid state, promoting anaerobic digestion with less water input. Both methods effectively convert organic matter into biogas, serving renewable energy and waste management needs.</p></p>
